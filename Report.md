> Write your report in this document. You can write it in English or French


Traffic model (2p)
------------------

Describe which traffic model you use to model the incoming requests. Justify your choice.


Evaluation of the options 1-3 (3x 9p)
-------------------------------------

Document your findings are results here. In particular, for each option, answer the following questions:

1. Which queueing model do you use to model this option? Justify your choice. (2p)
2. What is the maximum throughput of this option (requests per second)? (1p)
3. Show a plot of the mean and 99th percentile of the response time as a function of the utilization (from 0.1 to 0.9). (3p)
4. What are the numeric values of the mean and 99th percentile of the response time at for low (rho=0.1), medium (rho=0.5), and high (rho=0.9) utilization? (3p)


Evaluation of option 4 (6p)
----------------------------

Document your findings are results here by answering the following questions:

1. How does adding the old server affect the maximum throughput? Does it decrease, increase, or stay the same? (2p)
2. How does adding the old server affect the response time? Does it decrease, increase, or stay the same? (2p)
3. Can you imagine a scenario where adding the old server is useful? (2p)


Recommendation (5p)
-------------------

Based on your findings, which option would you recommend to the company? (2p)

Besides the best solution, could the other options be useful in some scenarios? (3p)


Conclusion (4p)
---------------

Describe what you have learned about designing server farms. (2p)

Describe a case where 99th percentile have been useful in this lab. (2p)
